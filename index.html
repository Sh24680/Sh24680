        <p> Hello everybody! My name is Anushree Majumdar. Right now, I am 14 years old. I am going to Neuqua Valley High School as a freshman! I love music! I play the piano and the violin, and I also sing Indian Classical Music. I also like listening to pop songs on the radio. If you ever see me in the car, you will probably find me jamming to a song. :P Another hobby of mine is to read. A few of my favorite books/series are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The Red Queen series</li>
            <li> Nightshade series</li>
            <li> The Alchemyst series</li>
        </ul>

        <a href = "index1.html">  I recently wrote an essay on the differences between Western Classical Music and Indian Classical Music.</a>
